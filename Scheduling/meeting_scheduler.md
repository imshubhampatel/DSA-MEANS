# Meeting Room Scheduler

## Problem Statement

Imagine you have a series of meetings, each with a start and end time. The goal is to determine the minimum number of rooms required so that no two overlapping meetings are scheduled in the same room.

## Solution Overview

To solve this problem, we treat each meeting as an interval defined by its start and end times. The algorithm calculates the minimum number of rooms (or groups) required, with each group representing a separate meeting room. This approach helps optimize room allocation and prevents scheduling conflicts.

### Steps to Implement the Solution

1. **List Meetings**: Gather all meetings with their respective start and end times.
2. **Create Time Points**: For each meeting, note down:
   - Start time
   - End time
3. **Sort Time Points**: Arrange all time points in chronological order. If two events occur at the same time, prioritize the end time.
4. **Count Overlaps**: Traverse through the sorted list and maintain a count of active meetings:
   - Increase the count at start times.
   - Decrease the count at end times.
5. **Determine Maximum Count**: The highest count reached during this process indicates the minimum number of rooms needed.

## Impact

Implementing this solution ensures:
- **Efficient Room Usage**: Maximizes the use of available meeting rooms.
- **Reduced Wasted Space**: Minimizes instances where rooms are left unused.
- **No Double-Booking**: Guarantees that meetings do not overlap in the same room.

## Example

Consider the following meetings:

- Meeting 1: 9 AM to 10 AM
- Meeting 2: 9:30 AM to 11 AM
- Meeting 3: 10 AM to 11:30 AM
- Meeting 4: 11 AM to 12 PM

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Time Points**:
   - Start: 9 AM, 9:30 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM
   - End: 10 AM, 11 AM, 11:30 AM, 12 PM
2. **Sorted Time Points**:
   - 9 AM (start)
   - 9:30 AM (start)
   - 10 AM (end)
   - 11 AM (start)
   - 11 AM (end)
   - 11:30 AM (end)
   - 12 PM (end)
3. **Counting Overlaps**:
   - At each time point, adjust the count based on whether it’s a start or end time.

### Result:

The maximum number of rooms needed for this example is **2**.

## Conclusion

By following this method, you can efficiently determine how many meeting rooms are necessary for any given schedule. This ensures smooth operations and optimal use of resources.


# Hospital Staffing Optimization

## Problem Statement

In a hospital, doctors work in shifts that sometimes overlap. The goal is to determine how many doctors are needed at the same time to ensure there are enough on duty without overscheduling.

## Solution Overview

Each doctor’s shift is treated as a time interval defined by a start time and an end time. By analyzing these intervals, we can find the maximum number of doctors that need to be on duty simultaneously.

## Impact

This approach helps ensure:
- **Adequate Staffing**: There are enough doctors available for patients.
- **Minimized Overscheduling**: Avoid having too many doctors scheduled at once.
- **Optimized Personnel Allocation**: Reduces idle time and costs while preventing gaps in coverage.

## Example

Consider the following shifts for three doctors:

- **Doctor A**: 8 AM to 12 PM
- **Doctor B**: 10 AM to 2 PM
- **Doctor C**: 1 PM to 5 PM

### Steps to Determine Minimum Doctors Needed

1. **Identify Time Intervals**:
   - Doctor A: 8 AM - 12 PM
   - Doctor B: 10 AM - 2 PM
   - Doctor C: 1 PM - 5 PM

2. **Count Overlaps**:
   - From **8 AM to 10 AM**: Only Doctor A is on duty (1 doctor).
   - From **10 AM to 12 PM**: Doctors A and B are both on duty (2 doctors).
   - From **12 PM to 1 PM**: Only Doctor B is on duty (1 doctor).
   - From **1 PM to 2 PM**: Doctors B and C are on duty (2 doctors).
   - From **2 PM to 5 PM**: Only Doctor C is on duty (1 doctor).

3. **Maximum Overlap**: The peak number of doctors needed at the same time is **2**, occurring between 10 AM and 12 PM.

## Conclusion

By using this method, hospitals can ensure they have adequate coverage while optimizing staff allocation and minimizing unnecessary costs.

# Data Stream Processing

## Problem Statement

When processing incoming data packets or requests that each have start and end times, servers must handle these requests without overlap to avoid congestion. The goal is to determine how many servers are required to manage overlapping packets without causing delays.

## Solution Overview

Each data packet’s time range is treated as an interval. By using a grouping technique, we can identify the maximum number of overlapping packets at any given time. This helps determine how many servers are needed to handle the requests efficiently.

## Impact

Implementing this solution ensures:
- **Minimized Latency**: Reduces delays in processing requests.
- **Prevention of Server Overload**: Ensures servers are not overwhelmed by too many simultaneous requests.
- **Optimized Server Resources**: Efficient use of server capacity, especially in high-traffic environments such as financial trading platforms or video streaming services.

## Example

Consider a scenario with the following data packets:

- **Packet 1**: 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM
- **Packet 2**: 10:15 AM to 10:45 AM
- **Packet 3**: 10:40 AM to 11:00 AM
- **Packet 4**: 10:50 AM to 11:20 AM

### Steps to Determine Servers Needed

1. **Identify Time Intervals**:
   - Packet 1: 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM
   - Packet 2: 10:15 AM - 10:45 AM
   - Packet 3: 10:40 AM - 11:00 AM
   - Packet 4: 10:50 AM - 11:20 AM

2. **Count Overlaps**:
   - From **10:00 AM to 10:15 AM**: Only Packet 1 is active (1 server).
   - From **10:15 AM to 10:30 AM**: Packets 1 and 2 are active (2 servers).
   - From **10:30 AM to 10:40 AM**: Only Packet 2 is active (1 server).
   - From **10:40 AM to 10:50 AM**: Packets 2 and 3 are active (2 servers).
   - From **10:50 AM to 11:00 AM**: Packets 3 and 4 are active (2 servers).
   - From **11:00 AM to 11:20 AM**: Only Packet 4 is active (1 server).

3. **Maximum Overlap**:
   The peak number of servers needed at the same time is **2**, occurring between **10:15 AM and 10:30 AM**, and also between **10:40 AM and 11:00 AM**.

## Conclusion

By applying this method, organizations can effectively manage their server resources, ensuring timely processing of data streams while preventing overloads and optimizing performance.

# Interval Grouping Problem

## Problem Recap

The goal is to split intervals into groups such that:
- No two intervals in the same group overlap (i.e., they do not share any common numbers).
- We want to minimize the number of groups.

Given the intervals: 

The minimum number of groups needed is **4**.

## Steps to Solve

### 1. Sort Intervals by Start Time

Sorting helps us process each interval in order of its start time, making it easier to place each interval in a group without overlap.

**Sorted Intervals**:




### 2. Use a Min-Heap to Track Group End Times

A min-heap helps efficiently track the end times of intervals in each group. By checking the earliest end time (the top of the heap), we can decide whether a new interval can fit into an existing group or if a new group is needed.

### 3. Process Each Interval

For each interval, we:

- **Check if it can be placed in an existing group**:
  - If the interval's start time is greater than the smallest end time in the heap, we remove that end time from the heap (indicating that the interval from that group has finished) and add the current interval’s end time to the heap for the same group.
  
- **If it cannot fit**:
  - If the interval’s start time does not exceed the smallest end time in the heap, we need a new group for this interval and add its end time to the heap.

### 4. Count the Groups

The number of elements in the heap at the end gives us the minimum number of groups needed.

## Step-by-Step Execution

Let's apply this to the sorted intervals `[[1, 5], [1, 10], [2, 3], [5, 10], [6, 8]]`:

1. **Interval [1, 5]**:
   - No groups exist, so we create a new group and add this interval's end time `5` to the heap.
   - **Heap**: `[5]`

2. **Interval [1, 10]**:
   - Start `1` is less than the smallest end time `5`, so this interval cannot fit in the existing group.
   - We create a new group and add this interval's end time `10` to the heap.
   - **Heap**: `[5, 10]`

3. **Interval [2, 3]**:
   - Start `2` is less than `5`, so it cannot fit into any existing group.
   - We create a new group and add `3` to the heap.
   - **Heap**: `[3, 10, 5]`

4. **Interval [5, 10]**:
   - Start `5` is greater than the smallest end time `3`, so we can place it in the group that ended at `3`.
   - We remove `3` from the heap and add `10` to the heap.
   - **Heap**: `[5, 10, 10]`

5. **Interval [6, 8]**:
   - Start `6` is greater than `5`, so it can fit in the group that ends at `5`.
   - We remove `5` from the heap and add `8` to the heap.
   - **Heap**: `[8, 10, 10]`

## Final Heap State

After processing all intervals, the heap has three end times `[8, 10, 10]`, indicating that we used **3 groups** for these intervals.

## Conclusion

By following this method and using a min-heap for tracking end times, we can efficiently determine how many groups are needed to accommodate overlapping intervals while minimizing conflicts.
